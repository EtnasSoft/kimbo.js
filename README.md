### An ECMAScript 5 only-compatible JavaScript library

The goal of this light-weight JavaScript library is to provide a nice, shorter and extended API for using native compliant JavaScript.
Taking advantage of its amazing speed, of course only in modern browsers, and no more adding extra bytes for older ones.

Make the switch and start using a robust, light-weight and modern library.

## Documentation
Please [visit the documentation](http://api.kimbojs.com) to see how easy is to use with its jQuery compatible API.

**Coming asap:**
